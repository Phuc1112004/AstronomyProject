        <h2>Space Launch System:
        </h2>
        <p>The Space Launch System is an American super heavy-lift expendable launch vehicle developed by NASA. As of 2022, SLS has the highest payload capacity of any rocket in operational service, as well as the greatest liftoff thrust of any rocket in operation.[24][25][26] As the primary launch vehicle of the Artemis moon landing program, SLS is designed to launch the crewed Orion spacecraft on a trans-lunar trajectory. The first SLS launch was the uncrewed Artemis 1, which took place on 16 November 2022 after a delay of more than six years.

          Development of SLS began in 2011, as a replacement for the retired Space Shuttle as well as the cancelled Ares I and Ares V launch vehicles. As a Shuttle-derived vehicle, the Space Launch System reuses hardware from the Space Shuttle program, including the solid rocket boosters and RS-25 first stage engines. An original flight date of late 2016 was delayed by nearly 6 years.[31] The SLS program has attracted criticism for such delays, high cost, and non-competitive use of Space Shuttle components and contractors.

        <p>
          All Space Launch System flights are launched from LC-39B at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The first three SLS flights use the Block 1 configuration, comprising extended Space Shuttle boosters developed for Ares I and the ICPS upper stage. An improved Block 1B configuration, with the EUS upper stage, is planned to debut on the fourth flight; a further improved Block 2 configuration featuring new solid rocket boosters is planned to debut on the ninth flight. After the first four flights, NASA plans to transfer production and launch operations of SLS to Deep Space Transport LLC, a joint venture between Boeing and Northrop Grumman
        </p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p class="p-2">
          The SLS is a Space Shuttle-derived launch vehicle. The first stage of the rocket is powered by one central core stage and two outboard solid rocket boosters. All SLS Blocks share a common core stage design, while they differ in their upper stages and boosters.
        </p>
        <div class="text-center p-2">

        </div>
        <h5>Core stage:</h5>
        <p>
          Together with the solid rocket boosters, the core stage is responsible for propelling the upper stage and payload out of the atmosphere to near orbital velocity. It contains the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tanks for the ascent phase, the forward and aft solid rocket booster attach points, avionics, and the Main Propulsion System (MPS), an assembly of the four RS-25 engines,[37] associated plumbing and hydraulic gimbal actuators, and equipment for autogenous pressurization of the vehicle's tanks. The core stage provides approximately 25% of the vehicle's thrust at liftoff.[41][42]

          The stage measures 213 ft (65 m) long by 28 ft (8.4 m) in diameter and is both structurally and visually similar to the Space Shuttle external tank.[29][43] The first four flights will each use and expend four of the remaining sixteen RS-25D engines previously flown on Space Shuttle missions.[44][45][46] Aerojet Rocketdyne refits these engines with modernized engine controllers, higher throttle limits, as well as insulation for the high temperatures the engine section will experience due to their position adjacent to the solid rocket boosters.[47] Later flights will switch to a RS-25 variant optimized for expended use, the RS-25E, which will lower per-engine costs by over 30%.[48][49] The thrust of each RS-25D engine has been increased from 492,000 lbf (2,188 kN), as on the Space Shuttle, to 513,000 lbf (2,281 kN) on the sixteen modernized engines. The RS-25E will further increase per-engine thrust to 522,000 lbf (2,321 kN).
        </p>
        <h5>Boosters:</h5>
        <p>Blocks 1 and 1B of the SLS will use two five-segment solid rocket boosters. These solid rocket boosters use casing segments that were flown on Shuttle missions as parts of the four-segment Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters. They possess an additional center segment, new avionics, and lighter insulation, but lack a parachute recovery system, as they will not be recovered after launch.[52] The propellants for the solid rocket boosters are aluminum powder, which is very reactive, and ammonium perchlorate, a powerful oxidizer. They are held together by a binder, polybutadiene acrylonitrile (PBAN). The mixture has the consistency of a rubber eraser and is packed into each segment.[53] The five-segment solid rocket boosters provide approximately 25% more total impulse than the Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters, but will not be recovered after use.[54][55]

          The stock of SLS Block 1 to 1B boosters is limited by the number of casings left over from the Shuttle program, which allows for eight flights of the SLS.[56] On 2 March 2019, the Booster Obsolescence and Life Extension program was announced. This program will develop new solid rocket boosters, to be built by Northrop Grumman Space Systems, for further SLS flights, marking the beginning of Block 2. These boosters will be derived from the composite-casing solid rocket boosters then in development for the canceled OmegA launch vehicle, and are projected to increase Block 2's payload to 290,000 lb (130 t) to LEO and at least 101,000 lb (46 t) to trans-lunar injection.[57][58][59] As of July 2021, the BOLE program is under development, with first firing expected in 2024.</p>

        <h5>Upper stages:</h5>
        <p>
          The Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) flew on Artemis 1, and is planned for Artemis 2 and 3 as the upper stage of SLS Block 1.[60] It is a stretched and human-rated Delta IV 16 ft (5 m) Delta Cryogenic Second Stage powered by a single RL10 engine. The Artemis 1 ICPS used the RL10B-2 variant, while the ICPS for Artemis 2 and Artemis 3 will use the RL10C-2 variant.[61][62][63] Block 1 is intended to be capable of lifting 209,000 lb (95 t) to low Earth orbit (LEO) in this configuration, including the weight of the ICPS as part of the payload.[10] At the time of SLS core stage separation, Artemis 1 was travelling on an initial 1,806 by 30 km (1,122 by 19 mi) suborbital trajectory. This trajectory ensured safe disposal of the core stage.[64] ICPS then performed orbital insertion and a subsequent translunar injection burn to send Orion towards the Moon.[65] The ICPS will be human-rated for the crewed Artemis 2 and 3 flights.[60]

          The Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) is planned to fly on Artemis 4. The EUS will complete the SLS ascent phase and then re-ignite to send its payload to destinations beyond LEO.[66] It is expected to be used by Block 1B and Block 2. The EUS shares the core stage diameter of 8.4 meters, and will be powered by four RL10C-3 engines.[67] It will eventually be upgraded to use four improved RL10C-X engines.[68] As of March 2022, Boeing is developing a new composite-based fuel tank for the EUS that would increase Block 1B's overall payload mass capacity to TLI by 40 percent.[69] The improved upper stage was originally named the Dual Use Upper Stage (DUUS, pronounced "duce")[66] but was later renamed the Exploration Upper Stage (EUS).</p>
